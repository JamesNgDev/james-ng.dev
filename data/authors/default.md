I am Javascript Developer with 2 years of experience in Javascript technologies (Node.js, React.js, GraphQL, MongoDB..). Learning new languages and technologies is what I am passionate about. I am considered a team-player because I like to help other and tend to work well within groups. I like helping other and work well with group. I can also do some mentoring tasks.
